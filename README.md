# Setup Mac

This is a simple script and list of homebrew packages I use, to allow simple setup of my Macbook. This script will install any operating system updates, install xcode command line tools and then brew (and specified packages).

## Getting Started

After cloning the repo, simply run:

```
./setup-mac.sh
```

The list of packages to be installed can be found in brew.txt, and should be kept up to date as and when new packages are installed/needed.
